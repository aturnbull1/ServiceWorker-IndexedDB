# ServiceWorker-IndexedDB
This is an example app of how to use IndexedDB inside a Service Worker.

To run use python -m SimpleHTTPServer (or any local http server you want). 
The data from the users.json file will be asynchronously inserted into indexedDB. You can check by looking at the resources tab in developer tools.
